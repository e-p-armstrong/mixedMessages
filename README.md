### An insult generator

This simple script does one thing: attempt to make you angry. It might also make you laugh as an unintended side-effect.

Example randomly generated insult:
> Your second cousin twice removed is a detestable idiot!

This simple generator works by:
* Taking a noun from an array of user-related nouns
* Taking nother noun from an array of unflattering things that someone can be called
* Taking a two-item array from an array of adjectives (and their corresponding correct grammatical particle, ie, ["worthless","a"], or ["unapologetic","an"])
* Mashing these together with some standardized connecting words and returning the result.

Suggestions for additional nouns and adjectives are welcome, I suppose. And if I made a stupid mistake please tell me. And some sage parting words:

> Your dog is an unapologetic cur!
